# Donation Campaign Project

### Some features of this project

- **Responsive Design:** The navbar is designed to adapt its layout for different screen sizes. On small screens (e.g., mobile devices), a menu icon (AiOutlineMenu) appears, and clicking it
  reveals the navigation links in a dropdown (dropdown-content) fashion. This ensures the navbar is user-friendly on various devices.

- **Active Link Styling:** The navbar applies conditional styling to active links. Active links are styled with "text-[#FF444A] underline font-medium text-lg" to highlight them with a red color,
  underlined text, and a slightly bolder font weight. This provides visual feedback to users about their current page.

- **Search Input with Clear Functionality:** The search input field in the 'Searchbox' component allows users to enter search terms, and it provides a clear button to easily erase the entered
  text.

- **Donation Button and Storage:** The 'ItemCard' component includes a donation button that, when activated, stores item details (including the price) locally and displays a thank-you
  notification.

- **Donation Statistics Visualization:** The 'Statistics' component displays a pie chart that visually represents donation statistics. It calculates and presents the total donation percentage and
  the user's donation percentage in a user-friendly chart format, helping users understand their contribution compared to the total donations.
